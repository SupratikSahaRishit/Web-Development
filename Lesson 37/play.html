        <h1>Process for playing Cricket</h1>
        <p>To play cricket, set up a pitch with wickets at each end, divide into two teams of 11, and have one team bat while the
        other bowls and fields; batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets or hitting boundaries, while
        the fielding team tries to get batsmen "out" (e.g., by hitting wickets, catching the ball) before the batting team
        completes their innings, with the team scoring the most runs winning.</p>
