        <h1>Process for playing Football</h1>
        <p>Playing soccer involves two 45-minute halves starting with a kickoff, with the goal of scoring by placing the ball into
        the opponent's net using any body part except hands/arms (unless you are the goalkeeper). 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Key elements include mastering
        ball control (passing, dribbling, shooting) with feet, chest, or head, and applying tactical awareness to move the ball.</p>
