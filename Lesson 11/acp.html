            Charles Babbage (1791-1871) was an English mathematician and inventor, considered the "father of computing," who
            designed the first mechanical computers: the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. A polymath, Babbage also made
            contributions to philosophy and other sciences. He was intelligent and ambitious but also known for having a complex,
            difficult, and somewhat eccentric personality, which, along with his failure to secure sufficient funding, prevented him
            from completing his ambitious calculating machines during his lifetime.
